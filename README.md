# twitter_sentiment_game
This is my final project submission for <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50x</a> (Harvard/edx).

## The project
A game that requires you to guess the Tweet sentiment of a random Twitter user based their username, display picture, and bio.

## This Repo
This is the production version of the project. The development branch is <a href="https://github.com/joshamore/twitter_sentiment_game/tree/master">here</a>. The main difference is the use of SQLite3 in development and PostgreSQL in production.
